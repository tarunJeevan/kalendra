# Personal Calendar App
A scheduling app based on Calendly built using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Clerk, Neon database, and Drizzle ORM. 


## Improvements
- [ ] Add delayed event activation (set a date and time for an event to become public)
- [ ] Allow users to disable specific days in their schedule while preserving their created availabilities
- [ ] Look into adding other calendar integrations such as Outlook calendar, and Exchange calendar
- [ ] Add user customization features (e.g., dashboard layout, font family/size, color theming, etc.)
- [ ] Event sorting/searching via event names, colors, and tags
- [ ] Create group meetings that allow multiple people to register for it
- [ ] Allow non-users to create events for a registered user and send an invite for an available time slot
- [ ] Implement multi-select functionality to select multiple events to delete or edit (only change visibility)
- [ ] NOTE: Add favicon based on custom logo
